# Android App for notifying leftover food
Most of us throw away leftover food from our households in dustbins. However, this leftover food can still be used to satisfy hunger of many underprivileged people. Here we present a software solution to help notify available leftover food from our households. Our goal was to develop an Android application to allow willing food donors to notify availability of leftover food through Google Maps API.

# Instruction
If a donor intends to donate left over food, the application will record his/her pickup location (i.e. in the form of <latitude, longitude> through GPS). Once the pickup locations of donors are recorded in database, we can plot them on Google Maps API in the form of markers. This marked map can then be used by various NGOs to collect leftover food from their respective destinations and then distribute it among underprivileged people.
